# dropwizard-people
A quick variant on the dropwizard tutorial, to explore the tech.

This project is a fusion of a few different dropwizard tutorials and StackOverflow questions. 
The main "innovations" are the list of maps in the config, the use of a "Person" resource, and my first
steps toward unit testing. In the near future, I also hope to add an extra ... route? Whatever they're called.
